# Research Proposal: dHTTPS and Token3
## A Framework for Decentralized Trust and Value Attribution

### Abstract
This research proposal outlines a novel approach to web security and content validation through a decentralized HTTPS protocol (dHTTPS) coupled with an incentive mechanism (Token3). The proposed system aims to address fundamental limitations in current certificate authority models while creating economic incentives for infrastructure maintenance and content quality.
